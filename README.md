# credicxo_PRELIMINARY-TASK

This is the preliminary task for Credicxo Tech Private Limited

IN THIS PROJECT YOU FIND:

(1) MODEL ACCURACY GRAPH (ACCURACY VS VALUE ACCURACY)

(2) MODEL LOSS GRAPH (LOSS VS VALUE LOSS)

(3) MUSK_CSV DATASET (The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. )

(4)MUSK_MODEL.H5 (.h5 MODEL OF THIS DATASET FOR PREDICTION )

(5)MMUSK_MODEL_PREDICTION.PY (MY MAIN PYTHON SCRIPT FOR TRAIN AND TEST THE DATASET AND PLOTTING THE GRAPHS AND CREATE AND LOAD THE MODEL FOR PREDICTION)
